# QRCodeForParties

A quick program to make a QR code. Perfect for when friends and family show up to your place.

Last year, I had several friends over. It's literally the first time I hosted at my new place. However, my wifi password is intentionally long and cumbersome for people to type it up. So I found the Python library that creates the QR code. Not only did I have the QR code readily available in print, but also, I was broadcasting it off my Google Chrome so that it was on my big screen for when they arrived. Not only did it allow them to connect their phones easily, but it was a funny starter for a conversation.

So I figured, I wouldn't be surprised if others had the same issues. And I rewrote the script that was originally quickly typed in a notebook. Thankfully I kept an eye on the roast for the party and it didn't over cook.

## To run it

1. Open the WifiPassword.json file
1. Update the settings to match your Wifi
1. Open the QRDisplay.ipynb notebook
1. Run the first cell to get a new QR code.
1. Run the second cell in that notebook to save the image to the same directory. Perfect for Word docs and Photoshop.

And that's pretty much it. Use it and let me know if it helped your party, or other suggestions.
